# Web_scraper2

I built this webscraper te help teach myself about scraping data, as well as data presentation for UI/UX once it is stored in my database. This is an ongoing project I will be returning to. I created a secure login/user system, a local database and model which will update every 24 hours as long as the server is active, a responsive navbar and collapsible menu, and a basic pagination for ease of navigation. Book title links refer to pages on the external site I scraped, https://books.toscrape.com.
